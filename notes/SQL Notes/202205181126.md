# SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement
#sql_CREATE_DATABASE

The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new SQL database.
### Syntax
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <databasename>;
```

## CREATE DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement creates a database called "testDB":
```sql
CREATE DATABASE testDB;
```

> **Tip:** Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: `SHOW DATABASES`;

---
---


# SQL DROP DATABASE Statement
#sql_DROP_DATABASE

The `DROP DATABASE` statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

### Syntax
```sql
DROP DATABASE <databasename>;
```
> **Note:** Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database!

## DROP DATABASE Example

The following SQL statement drops the existing database "testDB":

```sql
DROP DATABASE testDB;
```

> **Tip:** Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: `SHOW DATABASES`;

# SQL BACKUP DATABASE for SQL Server
#sql_BACKUP_DATABASE

The `BACKUP DATABASE` statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.

### Syntax
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE _databasename_  
TO DISK = '_filepath_';
```
## The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement

A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.

### Syntax
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE _databasename_  
TO DISK = '_filepath_'  
WITH  DIFFERENTIAL;
```
---

## BACKUP DATABASE Example

The following SQL statement creates a full back up of the existing database "testDB" to the D disk:

### Example
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE testDB  
TO DISK = 'D:\\backups\\testDB.bak';
```
**Tip:** Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.

---


## BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Example

The following SQL statement creates a differential back up of the database "testDB":

### Example
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE testDB  
TO DISK = 'D:\\backups\\testDB.bak'  
WITH  DIFFERENTIAL;
```
**Tip:** A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).

# SQL CREATE TABLE Statement
The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in a database.

### Syntax
```sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name> ( 
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
    .....
);
```
The column parameters specify the names of the columns of the table.

The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, date, etc.).

**Tip:** For an overview of the available data types, go to our complete [Data Types Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp).


## SQL CREATE TABLE Example

The following example creates a table called "Persons" that contains five columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (  
     PersonID int,  
     LastName varchar(255),  
     FirstName varchar(255),  
     Address varchar(255),  
     City varchar(255)  
 );
```
The PersonID column is of type int and will hold an integer.

The LastName, FirstName, Address, and City columns are of type varchar and will hold characters, and the maximum length for these fields is 255 characters.

The empty "Persons" table will now look like this:


  ### Result:

You have made changes to the database.

| PersonID | LastName | FirstName | Address | City |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Tip:** The empty "Persons" table can now be filled with data with the SQL [INSERT INTO](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp) statement.

## Create Table Using Another Table

A copy of an existing table can also be created using `CREATE TABLE`.

The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.

If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE <new_table_name> AS  
SELECT <column1>, <column2>,...  
FROM <existing_table_name>
WHERE ....;
```
The following SQL creates a new table called "TestTables" (which is a copy of the "Customers" table):

```sql
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS  
SELECT customername, contactname  
FROM  customers;
```




# SQL DROP TABLE Statement

The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.

### Syntax
```sql
DROP TABLE <table_name>;
```
> **Note**: ** Be careful before dropping a table. Deleting a table will result in loss of complete information stored in the table!**

---

## SQL DROP TABLE Example

The following SQL statement drops the existing table "Shippers":

### Example
```sql
DROP TABLE Shippers; 
```

---

## SQL TRUNCATE TABLE

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.

### Syntax
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;
```

Q.
1. Write the correct SQL statement to delete a table called `Persons`.
```sql
DROP TABLE Persons;
```
