# SQL LIKE Operator
#sql_like
The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator:

*  The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
*  The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character

> **Note:** MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).

> The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>,...
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <columnN> LIKE <pattern>;
```
> **Tip:** You can also combine any number of conditions using `AND` or `OR` operators.

Here are some examples showing different `LIKE` operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:

| LIKE Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' | Finds any values that start with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' | Finds any values that end with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%' | Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' | Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length |
| WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' | Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o" |

```

Q.
1. Select all records where the value of the `City` column starts with the letter "a".

# SQL Wildcards
## SQL Wildcard Characters

A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the `[LIKE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp)` operator. The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

### Wildcard Characters in MS Access

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *   | Represents zero or more characters | bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob |
| ?   | Represents a single character | h?t finds hot, hat, and hit |
| \[\] | Represents any single character within the brackets | h\[oa\]t finds hot and hat, but not hit |
| !   | Represents any character not in the brackets | h\[!oa\]t finds hit, but not hot and hat |
| -   | Represents any single character within the specified range | c\[a-b\]t finds cat and cbt |
| #   | Represents any single numeric character | 2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295 |

### Wildcard Characters in SQL Server

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| %   | Represents zero or more characters | bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob |
| _   | Represents a single character | h_t finds hot, hat, and hit |
| \[\] | Represents any single character within the brackets | h\[oa\]t finds hot and hat, but not hit |
| ^   | Represents any character not in the brackets | h\[^oa\]t finds hit, but not hot and hat |
| -   | Represents any single character within the specified range | c\[a-b\]t finds cat and cbt |

All the wildcards can also be used in combinations!

Here are some examples showing different `LIKE` operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:

| LIKE Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' | Finds any values that starts with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' | Finds any values that ends with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' | Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length |
| WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' | Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o" |

## Demo Database

| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | WA1 1DP | UK  |

## Using the % Wildcard

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City containing the pattern "es":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';
 ```

## Using the _ Wildcard

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';
```
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, followed by "on":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';
```
## Using the [charlist] Wildcard

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
```
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';
```

## Using the \[!charlist\] Wildcard

The two following SQL statements select all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';
```
OR
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
```


Q.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[acs]%'
```
2. Select all records where the first letter of the `City` starts with anything from an "a" to an "f".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE ''
```
3. Select all records where the first letter of the `City` starts with anything from an "a" to an "f".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-f]%';

# SQL IN Operator

The `IN` operator allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.

The `IN` operator is a shorthand for multiple `OR` conditions.

### IN Syntax

```sql
SELECT <column-name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <column_name> IN (<value1>, <value2>, ....);
```
OR
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table_name>  
WHERE <column_name> IN (SELECT <STATEMENT>);
```
## Demo Database

The table below shows the complete "Customers" table from the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |

| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

## IN Operator Examples

The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers that are NOT located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers that are from the same countries as the suppliers:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM suppliers);
```

Q.
1. Use the `IN` operator to select all the records where `Country` is either "Norway" or "France".
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Norway', 'France');
```

2. Use the `IN` operator to select all the records where `Country` is NOT "Norway" and NOT "France".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Norway', 'France');

# SQL BETWEEN Operator
#sql_between
The `BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The `BETWEEN` operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

### BETWEEN Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <column_name> BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>;
```

# SQL Aliases
#sql_aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the `AS` keyword.

### Alias Column Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name> AS <alias_name>
FROM <table_name>;
```

### Alias Table Syntax

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name> AS <alias_name>;
```

## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |

And a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate | ShipperID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10354 | 58  | 8   | 1996-11-14 | 3   |
| 10355 | 4   | 6   | 1996-11-15 | 1   |
| 10356 | 86  | 6   | 1996-11-18 | 2   |

## Alias for Columns Examples

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. 

> **Note:** It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customer;
```
| Customer | Contact Person |
| --- | --- |
| Alfreds Futterkiste | KUMAR VISHNU |
| Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | KUMAR VISHNU |
| Antonio Moreno Taquería | KUMAR VISHNU |
| Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy |
| Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund |
| Blauer See Delikatessen | Hanna Moos |
| Blondel père et fils | Frédérique Citeaux |
| Bólido Comidas preparadas | Martín Sommer |

The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ', ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
```
BEFORE:
Number of Records: 91
| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Note:** MySQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address  
FROM Customers;
```
**Note:** Oracle Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, (Address || ', ' || PostalCode || ' ' || City || ', ' ||  Country) AS Address  
FROM Customers;
```

## Alias for Tables Example

The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):

```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
```



The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
```
Number of Records: 2

| OrderID | OrderDate | CustomerName |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10355 | 1996-11-15 | Around the Horn |
| 10383 | 1996-12-16 | Around the Horn |

Aliases can be useful when:

* There are more than one table involved in a query
* Functions are used in the query
* Column names are big or not very readable
* Two or more columns are combined together


Q.
1. When displaying the `Customers` table, make an ALIAS of the `PostalCode` column, the column should be called `Pno` instead.

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, Address, PostalCode AS Pno
FROM Customers;
```

2. When displaying the `Customers` table, refer to the table as `Consumers` instead of `Customers`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers AS Consumers;
```
