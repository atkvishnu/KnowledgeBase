## SQL SELECT Statement
#sql_select
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a DB.
The data returned is stored in a `result` table, called the `result-set`.

#### SELECT Syntax:

```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, …
FROM <table_name>
```
Here, column1, column2, … are the field name of the table you want to select data from. 
If you want to select table from all the fields available in the table, use *.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
```

Example:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |
#### SELECT Column Example
The following SQL command selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the  "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
```

#### SELECT * Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

> Q. Select all the different values from the Country column in the `Customers` table.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
```

# SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
#sql_select_distinct
The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values, and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

##### SELECT DISTINCT Syntax
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT <column1>, <column2>, ...
FROM <table_name>;
```

## Demo Database

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

## SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
The following SQL statement selects all (including the duplicates) values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT Country FROM Customers;
```
## SELECT DISTINCT Examples
The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Coustomers;
```
The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
```
> **Note: The example above will not work in Firefox!** Because COUNT(DISTINCT _column_name_) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox is using Microsoft Access in our examples.

Here is the workaround for MS Access:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers); 
```

# SQL WHERE Clause
#sql_select_where
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.
It's used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

##### WHERE Syntax.
```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>;
```
> **Note:** The `WHERE` clause is not only used in `SELECT` statements, it is also used in `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.!

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

## WHERE Clause Example
#sql_where
The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE (Country='Mexico');
```

## Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
#text_fields_vs_numeric_fields
**SQL requires `single quotes` around text values (most databases will also allow double quotes). 
However, `numeric fields` should not be enclosed in quotes!**

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

## Operators in The WHERE Clause

The following operators can be used in the `WHERE` clause:

| Operator | Description                                                                     |
|----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| =        | Equal                                                                           |
| *>*      | Greater than                                                                    |
| <        | Less than                                                                       |
| >=       | Greater than or equal                                                           |
| <=       | Less than or equal                                                              |
| <>       | Not equal. **Note:** In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != |
| BETWEEN  | Between a certain range                                                         |
| LIKE     | Search for a pattern                                                            |
| IN       | To specify multiple possible values for a column                                |


Q:
1. Select all records where the `City` column has the value "Berlin".
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin';
```

# SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
#sql_and_or_not
The `WHERE` clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
The `AND` and `OR` operators are used to filter records based on more than one conditions:

- The `AND` operator displays a record if all the conditions seperated by `AND` are TRUE.
- The `OR` operator displays a record if any of the conditions seperated by `OR` is TRUE.

The `NOT` operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

### AND Syntax
#sql_and
```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition1> AND <condition2> AND <condition3> ...;
```


### OR Syntax
#sql_or
```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition1> OR <condition2> OR <condition3> ...;
```

### NOT Syntax
#sql_not
```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ..._  
FROM <table_name>  
WHERE NOT <condition>;
```

## AND Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city is "Berlin":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';
```
## OR Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where city is "Berlin" OR "München":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';
```
The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" OR "Spain":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer
WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';
``` 

## NOT Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany'; 
```

## Combining AND, OR and NOT

You can also combine the `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operators.

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "München" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');
```
The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is NOT "Germany" and NOT "USA":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Germany' AND NOT Country= 'USA';
```

Q:
1. Use the `NOT` keyword to select all records where `City` is NOT "Berlin".
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT City = 'Berlin';
```
2. Select all records where the `CustomerID` column has the value 32.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 32;
```
3. Select all records where the `City` column has the value 'Berlin' _and_ the `PostalCode` column has the value 12209.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' AND PostalCode = 12209;
```
4. Select all records where the `City` column has the value 'Berlin' or 'London'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin'
OR City = 'London';
```
