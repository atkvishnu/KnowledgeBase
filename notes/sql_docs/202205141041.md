# SQL Joins
#sql_joins
==A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.==

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | 2   | 1996-09-18 |
| 10309 | 37  | 1996-09-19 |
| 10310 | 77  | 1996-09-20 |

Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mexico |

Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an `INNER JOIN`), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

and it will produce something like this:

| OrderID | CustomerName | OrderDate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | 9/18/1996 |
| 10365 | Antonio Moreno Taquería | 11/27/1996 |
| 10383 | Around the Horn | 12/16/1996 |
| 10355 | Around the Horn | 11/15/1996 |
| 10278 | Berglunds snabbköp | 8/12/1996 |


## Different Types of SQL JOINs

Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

* `(INNER) JOIN`: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
* `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
* `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
* `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

![SQL INNER JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)  ![SQL LEFT JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_leftjoin.gif)  ![SQL RIGHT JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_rightjoin.gif)  ![SQL FULL OUTER JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_fulljoin.gif)






Q.
1. Insert the missing parts in the `JOIN` clause to join the two tables `Orders` and `Customers`, using the `CustomerID` field in both tables as the relationship between the two tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```
2. Choose the correct `JOIN` clause to select all records from the two tables where there is a match in both tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```
3. Choose the correct `JOIN` clause to select all the records from the `Customers` table plus all the matches in the `Orders` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

## SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
#sql_INNER_JOIN

The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

### INNER JOIN Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table1>
INNER JOIN <table2>
ON <table1.column_name>=<table2.column_name>;
```
![SQL INNER JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)


## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate | ShipperID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | 2   | 7   | 1996-09-18 | 3   |
| 10309 | 37  | 3   | 1996-09-19 | 1   |
| 10310 | 77  | 8   | 1996-09-20 | 2   |

And a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
## SQL INNER JOIN Example

The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer information:
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```
O/P: Number of Records: 196
| OrderID | CustomerName |
| --- | --- |
| 10248 | Wilman Kala |
| 10249 | Tradição Hipermercados |
| 10250 | Hanari Carnes |
| 10251 | Victuailles en stock |
| 10252 | Suprêmes délices |

**Note:** The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!

---

##  JOIN Three Tables

The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM (
    (Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
    INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
);
```
O/P: Number of Records: 196
| OrderID | CustomerName | ShipperName |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10248 | Wilman Kala | Federal Shipping |
| 10249 | Tradição Hipermercados | Speedy Express |
| 10250 | Hanari Carnes | United Package |
| 10251 | Victuailles en stock | Speedy Express |
| 10252 | Suprêmes délices | United Package |

---

---
## SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
#sql_LEFT_JOIN

The `LEFT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

### LEFT JOIN Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table1>  
LEFT JOIN <table2>  
ON <table1.column_name> = <table2.column_name>; 
```
**Note:** In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.

![SQL LEFT JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_leftjoin.gif)



## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |

And a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate | ShipperID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | 2   | 7   | 1996-09-18 | 3   |
| 10309 | 37  | 3   | 1996-09-19 | 1   |
| 10310 | 77  | 8   | 1996-09-20 | 2   |

## SQL LEFT JOIN Example

The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```
O/P: Number of Records: 213
| CustomerName | OrderID |
| --- | --- |
| Alfreds Futterkiste | _null_ |
| Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | 10308 |
| Antonio Moreno Taquería | 10365 |
| Around the Horn | 10355 |
| Around the Horn | 10383 |

---

## SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
#sql_RIGHT_JOIN

The `RIGHT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

### RIGHT JOIN Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table1>  
RIGHT JOIN <table2>  
ON <table1.column_name> = <table2.column_name>; 
```

**Note:** In some databases `RIGHT JOIN` is called `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.

![SQL RIGHT JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_rightjoin.gif)

## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate | ShipperID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | 2   | 7   | 1996-09-18 | 3   |
| 10309 | 37  | 3   | 1996-09-19 | 1   |
| 10310 | 77  | 8   | 1996-09-20 | 2   |

And a selection from the "Employees" table:

| EmployeeID | LastName | FirstName | BirthDate | Photo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Davolio | Nancy | 12/8/1968 | EmpID1.pic |
| 2   | Fuller | Andrew | 2/19/1952 | EmpID2.pic |
| 3   | Leverling | Janet | 8/30/1963 | EmpID3.pic |



## SQL RIGHT JOIN Example

The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName  
FROM Orders  
RIGHT JOIN Employees 
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID  
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
```
O/P: Number of Records: 197

| OrderID | LastName | FirstName |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | West | Adam |
| 10248 | Buchanan | Steven |
| 10249 | Suyama | Michael |
| 10250 | Peacock | Margaret |


**Note:** The `RIGHT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).



---

---

## SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
#sql_FULL_OUTER_JOIN

The `FULL OUTER JOIN` keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

**Tip:** `FULL OUTER JOIN` and `FULL JOIN` are the same.

### FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table1>  
FULL OUTER JOIN <table2>  
ON <table1.column_name> = <table2.column_name>  
WHERE <condition>;
```

![SQL FULL OUTER JOIN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_fulljoin.gif)

**Note:** `FULL OUTER JOIN` can potentially return very large result-sets!

## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |

And a selection from the "Orders" table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | EmployeeID | OrderDate | ShipperID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10308 | 2   | 7   | 1996-09-18 | 3   |
| 10309 | 37  | 3   | 1996-09-19 | 1   |
| 10310 | 77  | 8   | 1996-09-20 | 2   |


## SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Example

The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID  
FROM Customers  
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID  
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```
A selection from the result set may look like this:

| CustomerName | OrderID |
| --- | --- |
| _Null_ | 10309 |
| _Null_ | 10310 |
| Alfreds Futterkiste | _Null_ |
| Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | 10308 |
| Antonio Moreno Taquería | _Null_ |

**Note:** The `FULL OUTER JOIN` keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.

---

## SQL Self Join
#sql_self_join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

### Self Join Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table1 T1>, <table1 T2>  
WHERE <condition>;
```
_T1_ and _T2_ are different table aliases for the same table.

---

## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |

## SQL Self Join Example

The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:

```sql
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```
### Result:

Number of Records: 80

| CustomerName1 | CustomerName2 | City |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cactus Comidas para llevar | Océano Atlántico Ltda. | Buenos Aires |
| Cactus Comidas para llevar | Rancho grande | Buenos Aires |
| Océano Atlántico Ltda. | Cactus Comidas para llevar | Buenos Aires |
| Océano Atlántico Ltda. | Rancho grande | Buenos Aires |
| Rancho grande | Cactus Comidas para llevar | Buenos Aires |
| Rancho grande | Océano Atlántico Ltda. | Buenos Aires |
| Furia Bacalhau e Frutos do Mar | Princesa Isabel Vinhoss | Lisboa |

# The SQL UNION Operator
#sql_UNION
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more `SELECT` statements.

* Every `SELECT` statement within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
* The columns must also have similar data types
* The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order

### UNION Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)> FROM <table1>
UNION
SELECT <column_name(s)> FROM <table2>;
```
### UNION ALL Syntax

The `UNION` operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)> FROM <table1>
UNION ALL 
SELECT <column_name(s)> FROM <table2>;
```
**Note:** The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first `SELECT` statement.
## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |

And a selection from the "Suppliers" table:

| SupplierID | SupplierName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Exotic Liquid | Charlotte Cooper | 49 Gilbert St. | London | EC1 4SD | UK  |
| 2   | New Orleans Cajun Delights | Shelley Burke | P.O. Box 78934 | New Orleans | 70117 | USA |
| 3   | Grandma Kelly's Homestead | Regina Murphy | 707 Oxford Rd. | Ann Arbor | 48104 | USA |


## SQL UNION Example

The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

### Example
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```
###### Result:
Number of Records: 95
| City |
| --- |
| Aachen |
| Albuquerque |
| Anchorage |
| Ann Arbor |
| Annecy |
| Barcelona |
**Note:** If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because `UNION` selects only distinct values. Use `UNION ALL` to also select duplicate values!

## SQL UNION ALL Example
#sql_UNION_ALL
The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

### Example
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers  
UNION ALL  
SELECT City FROM Suppliers  
ORDER BY City;
```
###### Result: Number of Records: 120
| City |
| --- |
| Aachen |
| Albuquerque |
| Anchorage |
| Ann Arbor |
| Annecy |

## SQL UNION With WHERE
#sql_UNION_with_WHERE

The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers  
WHERE Country='Germany'  
UNION  
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers  
WHERE Country='Germany'  
ORDER BY City;
```
###### Result: Number of Records: 14
| City | Country |
| --- | --- |
| Aachen | Germany |
| Berlin | Germany |
| Brandenburg | Germany |
| Cunewalde | Germany |
| Cuxhaven | Germany |



## SQL UNION ALL With WHERE
#sql_UNION_ALL_with_WHERE
The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers  
WHERE Country='Germany'  
UNION ALL  
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers  
WHERE Country='Germany'  
ORDER BY City;
```
###### Result: Number of Records: 14
| City | Country |
| --- | --- |
| Aachen | Germany |
| Berlin | Germany |
| Brandenburg | Germany |
| Cunewalde | Germany |
| Cuxhaven | Germany |
| Frankfurt | Germany |


## Another UNION Example

The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:

```sql
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country  
FROM Customers  
UNION  
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country  
FROM Suppliers;
```


##### Result: Number of Records: 119
| Type | ContactName | City | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer | Alejandra Camino | Madrid | Spain |
| Customer | Alexander Feuer | Leipzig | Germany |
| Customer | Anabela Domingues | São Paulo | Brazil |
| Customer | André Fonseca | Campinas | Brazil |

Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. [SQL Aliases](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp) are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. An alias only exists for the duration of the query. So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".

# SQL GROUP BY Statement

#sql_GROUP_BY

The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

### GROUP BY Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>
GROUP BY <column_name(s)>
ORDER BY <column_name(s)>;
```

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |

## SQL GROUP BY Examples

The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 21
| COUNT(CustomerID) | Country |
| --- | --- |
| 3   | Argentina |
| 2   | Austria |
| 2   | Belgium |
| 9   | Brazil |
| 3   | Canada |
| 2   | Denmark |
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country  
FROM Customers  
GROUP BY Country  
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 21
| COUNT(CustomerID) | Country |
| --- | --- |
| 13  | USA |
| 11  | Germany |
| 11  | France |
| 9   | Brazil |
| 7   | UK  |

| ShipperID | ShipperName |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | Speedy Express |
| 2   | United Package |
| 3   | Federal Shipping |

---

## GROUP BY With JOIN Example

The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:

```sql
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM  Orders  
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID  
GROUP BY ShipperName;
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 3
| ShipperName | NumberOfOrders |
| --- | --- |
| Federal Shipping | 68  |
| Speedy Express | 54  |
| United Package | 74  |
Q.
1. List the number of customers in each country.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```

2. List the number of customers in each country, ordered by the country with the most customers first.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```

---

---

# SQL HAVING Clause
#sql_HAVING
The `HAVING` clause was added to SQL because the `WHERE` keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

### HAVING Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table_name>  
WHERE <condition>  
GROUP BY <column_name(s)>  
HAVING <condition>  
ORDER BY <column_name(s)>;
```
