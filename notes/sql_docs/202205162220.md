# SQL ANY and ALL Operators
#sql_ANY
#sql_ALL
The `ANY` and `ALL` operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.

---

## The SQL ANY Operator

The `ANY` operator:

* returns a boolean value as a result
* returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition

`ANY` means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

### ANY Syntax
```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)> 
FROM <table_name> 
WHERE <column_name> operator ANY 
    (SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>);
```
> **Note:** The _operator_ must be a standard comparison operator (=, &lt;>, !=, &gt;, >=, <, or <=).

## The SQL ALL Operator

The `ALL` operator:

* returns a boolean value as a result
* returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
* is used with `SELECT`, `WHERE` and `HAVING` statements

`ALL` means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

### ALL Syntax With SELECT

```sql
SELECT ALL <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>;
```

### ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVING

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>  
FROM <table_name>  
WHERE <column_name> operator ALL  
  (SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>);
```
> **Note:** The _operator_ must be a standard comparison operator (=, &lt;>, !=, &gt;, >=, <, or <=).

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the **"Products"** table in the Northwind sample database:

| ProductID | ProductName | SupplierID | CategoryID | Unit | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Chais | 1   | 1   | 10 boxes x 20 bags | 18  |
| 2   | Chang | 1   | 1   | 24 - 12 oz bottles | 19  |
| 3   | Aniseed Syrup | 1   | 2   | 12 - 550 ml bottles | 10  |
| 4   | Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning | 2   | 2   | 48 - 6 oz jars | 22  |
| 5   | Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix | 2   | 2   | 36 boxes | 21.35 |
| 6   | Grandma's Boysenberry Spread | 3   | 2   | 12 - 8 oz jars | 25  |
| 7   | Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears | 3   | 7   | 12 - 1 lb pkgs. | 30  |
| 8   | Northwoods Cranberry Sauce | 3   | 2   | 12 - 12 oz jars | 40  |
| 9   | Mishi Kobe Niku | 4   | 6   | 18 - 500 g pkgs. | 97  |

And a selection from the **"OrderDetails"** table:

| OrderDetailID | OrderID | ProductID | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 10248 | 11  | 12  |
| 2   | 10248 | 42  | 10  |
| 3   | 10248 | 72  | 5   |
| 4   | 10249 | 14  | 9   |
| 5   | 10249 | 51  | 40  |
| 6   | 10250 | 41  | 10  |
| 7   | 10250 | 51  | 35  |
| 8   | 10250 | 65  | 15  |
| 9   | 10251 | 22  | 6   |
| 10  | 10251 | 57  | 15  |

---

---

## SQL ANY Examples
#sql_ANY
The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values of 10):

```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
    (SELECT ProductID 
     FROM OrderDetails 
     WHERE Quantity = 10);
```
### Result: Number of Records: 31

| ProductName |
| --- |
| Chais |
| Chang |
| Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning |
| Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears |


The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values larger than 99):

```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity > 99);
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 2

| ProductName |
| --- |
| Steeleye Stout |
| Pâté chinois |




The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000 (this will return FALSE because the Quantity column has no values larger than 1000):

```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity > 1000);
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 0




## SQL ALL Examples
#sql_ALL
The following SQL statement lists ALL the product names:

```sql
SELECT ALL ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE True;
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 77

| ProductName |
| --- |
| Chais |
| Chang |
| Aniseed Syrup |
| Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning |
| Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix |



The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10. This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):

```sql
SELECT ProductName  
FROM Products  
WHERE ProductID = ALL  
  (SELECT ProductID  
 FROM OrderDetails  
 WHERE Quantity = 10);
```
### Result:
Number of Records: 0

# SQL SELECT INTO Statement

The `SELECT INTO` statement copies data from one table into a new table.

### SELECT INTO Syntax

Copy all columns into a new table:

```ssql
SELECT *
INTO <newtable> [IN <externaldb>]
FROM <oldtable>
WHERE <condition>;
```

Copy only some columns into a new table:
```sql
SELECT <column1>, <column2>, <column3>, ....
INTO <newtable> [IN <externaldb>]
FROM <oldtable>
WHERE <condition>;
```
The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the `AS` clause.

  


## SQL SELECT INTO Examples
#sql_SELECT_INTO
The following SQL statement creates a backup copy of Customers:

```sql
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017  
FROM Customers;
```


The following SQL statement uses the `IN` clause to copy the table into a new table in another database:
```sql
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'  
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement copies only a few columns into a new table:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName INTO CustomersBackup2017  
FROM Customers;
```


The following SQL statement copies only the German customers into a new table:
```sql
SELECT * INTO CustomersGermany  
FROM Customers  
WHERE Country = 'Germany';
```


The following SQL statement copies data from more than one table into a new table:

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID  
INTO CustomersOrderBackup2017  
FROM Customers  
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

> **Tip:** `SELECT INTO` can also be used to create a new, empty table using the schema of another. Just add a `WHERE` clause that causes the query to return no data:


```sql
SELECT * INTO newtable  
FROM oldtable  
WHERE 1 = 0;
```

# SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement
#sql_INSERT_INTO_SELECT
The `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

The `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match.

**Note:** The existing records in the target table are unaffected.

### INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax

Copy all columns from one table to another table:
```sql
INSERT INTO <table2>
SELECT * FROM <table1>
WHERE <condition>;
```

Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
```sql
INSERT INTO _table2 _(_column1_, _column2_, _column3_, ...)  
SELECT _column1_, _column2_, _column3_, ...  
FROM _table1_  
WHERE _condition_;
```

## Demo Database

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database.

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |

And a selection from the "Suppliers" table:

| SupplierID | SupplierName | ContactName | Address | City | Postal Code | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Exotic Liquid | Charlotte Cooper | 49 Gilbert St. | Londona | EC1 4SD | UK  |
| 2   | New Orleans Cajun Delights | Shelley Burke | P.O. Box 78934 | New Orleans | 70117 | USA |
| 3   | Grandma Kelly's Homestead | Regina Murphy | 707 Oxford Rd. | Ann Arbor | 48104 | USA |

---

---

## SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Examples

The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,  City, Country)  
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
```
### Result:
You have made changes to the database. Rows affected: 29



The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode,  Country)  
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode,  Country FROM Suppliers;
```
### Result:
You have made changes to the database. Rows affected: 29


The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,  City, Country)  
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers  
WHERE Country='Germany';
```
#### Result:
You have made changes to the database. Rows affected: 3

# SQL CASE Statement
#sql_CASE
The `CASE` statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the `ELSE` clause.

If there is no `ELSE` part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

## CASE Syntax

```sql
CASE
    WHEN <condition1> THEN <result1>
    WHEN <condition2> THEN <result2>
    WHEN <conditionN> THEN <resultN>
    ELSE <result>
END;    
```
## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "OrderDetails" table in the Northwind sample database:

| OrderDetailID | OrderID | ProductID | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 10248 | 11  | 12  |
| 2   | 10248 | 42  | 10  |
| 3   | 10248 | 72  | 5   |
| 4   | 10249 | 14  | 9   |
| 5   | 10249 | 51  | 40  |

---

---

## SQL CASE Examples
#sql_CASE
The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:

```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,  
CASE  
    WHEN Quantity > 30   THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'  
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'  
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'  
END AS QuantityText  
FROM OrderDetails;
```
#### Result: 
Number of Records: 2155

| OrderID | Quantity | QuantityText |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10248 | 12  | The quantity is under 30 |
| 10248 | 10  | The quantity is under 30 |
| 10248 | 5   | The quantity is under 30 |
| 10249 | 9   | The quantity is under 30 |
| 10249 | 40  | The quantity is greater than 30 |






The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country  
FROM Customers  
ORDER BY  
(CASE  
   WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country  
   ELSE City  
END);
```
#### Result: 
Number of Records: 91

| CustomerName | City | Country |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drachenblut Delikatessend | Aachen | Germany |
| Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery | Albuquerque | USA |
| Old World Delicatessen | Anchorage | USA |
| Vaffeljernet | Århus | Denmark |

# SQL NULL Functions
#sql_NULL_functions

## SQL IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NVL() Functions

Look at the following "Products" table:

| P_Id | ProductName | UnitPrice | UnitsInStock | UnitsOnOrder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Jarlsberg | 10.45 | 16  | 15  |
| 2   | Mascarpone | 32.56 | 23  |     |
| 3   | Gorgonzola | 15.67 | 9   | 20  |

Suppose that the "UnitsOnOrder" column is optional, and may contain NULL values.

Look at the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder)
FROM Products;
```
In the example above, if any of the "UnitsOnOrder" values are NULL, the result will be NULL.

## Solutions

**MySQL**
The MySQL [IFNULL()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_ifnull.asp) function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:

```sql
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;
```
or we can use the [COALESCE()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_coalesce.asp) function, like this:

```sql
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;
```

**SQL Server**

The SQL Server [ISNULL()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_isnull.asp) function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL:
```sql
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;
```

or we can use the [COALESCE()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_coalesce.asp) function, like this:
```sql`
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;
```

**MS Access**

The MS Access `[IsNull()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_msaccess_isnull.asp)` function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0):

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))  
FROM Products;

**Oracle**

The Oracle `NVL()` function achieves the same result:

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;

or we can use the `COALESCE()` function, like this:

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))  
FROM Products;



# SQL Stored Procedures for SQL Server

## What is a Stored Procedure?
#sql_stored_procedure
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

### Stored Procedure Syntax
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE <procedure_name>
AS
<sql_statement>
GO;
```
### Execute a Stored Procedure
```sql
EXEC <procedure_name>;
```


## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

---

## Stored Procedure Example

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers
GO;
```
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers;
```

---

---

## Stored Procedure With One Parameter

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:

### Example
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers  @City nvarchar(30)  
AS  
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE  City = @City  
GO; 
```
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
```
 EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';
```

---

## Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters

List each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:

### Example
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers  @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)  
AS  
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE  City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode  
GO; 
```
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';
```

# SQL Comments
#sql_comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

> **Note: The examples in this chapter will not work in Firefox and Microsoft Edge!**
> Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox and Microsoft Edge are using Microsoft Access database in our examples.

---

## Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with `--`.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:

```sql
--Select all:  
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore the end of a line:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';
```

The following example uses a single-line comment to ignore a statement:
```sql
--SELECT * FROM Customers;  
SELECT * FROM Products;
```

---

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:

```sql
/*Select all the columns  
of all the records  
in the Customers table:*/  
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

The following example uses a multi-line comment to ignore many statements:
```sql
/*SELECT * FROM Customers;  
SELECT * FROM Products;  
SELECT * FROM Orders;  
SELECT * FROM Categories;*/  
SELECT * FROM Suppliers;
```
To ignore just a part of a statement, also use the /* */ comment.

The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a line:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, /*City,*/ Country FROM Customers;
```

The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a statement:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE (CustomerName LIKE 'L%'  
OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%' /*OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%'  
OR CustomerName LIKE 'T%'*/ OR CustomerName LIKE 'W%')  
AND Country='USA'  
ORDER BY CustomerName;
```
