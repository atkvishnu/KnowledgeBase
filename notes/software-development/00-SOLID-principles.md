# SOLID principles

There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also have the knowledge of the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming.

SOLID principle was introduced by _**Robert C. Martin**_, it is a coding standard in programming.

SOLID:
1.  `Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`
2.  `Open/Closed Principle`
3.  `Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)`
4.  `Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`
5.  `Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)`

SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling.
