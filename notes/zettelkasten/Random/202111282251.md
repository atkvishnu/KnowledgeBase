-   Become an **_autodidact_**.
-   Floating point computations are _not_ precise.
-   Don't stop learning.
-   #1 thing you can do to increase the quality and maintainability of your code is REDUCE DUPLICATION.
-   **Troubleshooting and Debugging Skills**. Every programmer should know how to use the debugger, and know how to use it **well**.
-   Names matter.
-   A function does 1 thing and does it well.
-   Learn concepts before technologies/framework! You can Google the syntax later.
-   Critical and logical thinking.
-   Every programmer should know about testing. Unit Testing is a great way to codify your assumptions on how the code is to be used.
-   Domain knowledge. The spec is never 100%; knowing the actual domain with which you are developing for will ALWAYS increase the quality of the product.
-   Pointers.
-   `Divide and Conquer` usually is the best way to solve any type of practical problem from scheduling to debugging.
-   True skill is reflected in the ability to execute a simple design well, not in the ability to make a complicated design work at all.
-   Data structures.
-   How to Google.
