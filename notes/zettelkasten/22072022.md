# size_t


`size_t` is an **unsigned** integral data type.

- Itâ€™s a type which is used to represent the size of objects in `bytes` and is therefore used as the `return type` by the `sizeof` operator.

- It is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object the host system can handle. 
- Basically the maximum permissible size is dependent on the compiler; if the compiler is 32 bit then it is simply a typedef(i.e., alias) for unsigned int but if the compiler is 64 bit then it would be a `typedef for unsigned long long`. The size_t data type is never negative.


- Therefore many C library functions like malloc, memcpy and strlen declare their arguments and return type as size_t.


```cpp

// Declaration of various standard library functions.
  
// Here argument of 'n' refers to maximum blocks that can be allocated which is guaranteed to be non-negative.
void *malloc(size_t n);
    
// While copying 'n' bytes from 's2' to 's1' n must be non-negative integer.
void *memcpy(void *s1, void const *s2, size_t n);
      
// strlen() uses size_t because the length of any string will always be at least 0.
size_t strlen(char const *s);

```
