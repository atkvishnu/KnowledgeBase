- A Tree is a type of graph!


# Tree vs. Binary Tree

- A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children!
- Not all trees are Binary Trees.
- Example: this tree is not a binary tree. We can call it a ternary tree

				8
			 /	|  \
			/	|	\
			4	6	10
		   /\        \
		  2  1        20



- There are occasions when you might have a tree that is not a binary tree.
- Example: Suppose we are using a tree to represent a bunch of phone numbers.
- In this case, you might use a 10-ary tree, with each node having up to 10 children (one for each digit).

- A node is called a "leaf" node if it has no children.



# Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree (BST)

- A Binary Search Tree(BST) is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property:
	`all left descendents <= n < all right descendents`
