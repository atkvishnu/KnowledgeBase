/**
 * @Question   Partition
 *
 * @Brief      
 * Write code to partition to linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x become all nodes
 * greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x
 * (see example). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the
 * left and right partitions. 
 *
 * @Example
 * Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
 * Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
 *
