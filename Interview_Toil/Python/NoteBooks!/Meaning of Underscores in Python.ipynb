    "# The Meaning of Underscores in Python\n",

    "“What’s the meaning of single and double underscores in Python variable and method names?” \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll discuss the following four underscore patterns and naming conventions and how they affect the behavior of your Python programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Leading Underscore: _var\n",
    "2. Single Trailing Underscore: var_\n",
