    "\n",
    "On the whole, yield is a fairly simple statement. Its primary job is to control the flow of a generator function in a way that’s similar to return statements. As briefly mentioned above, though, the Python yield statement has a few tricks up its sleeve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a generator function or use a generator expression, you return a special iterator called a <b>generator</b>. You can assign this generator to a variable in order to use it. When you call special methods on the generator, such as next(), the code within the function is executed up to yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python yield statement is hit, the program suspends function execution and returns the yielded value to the caller. (In contrast, return stops function execution completely.) When a function is suspended, the state of that function is saved. This includes any variable bindings local to the generator, the instruction pointer, the internal stack, and any exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to resume function execution whenever you call one of the generator’s methods. In this way, all function evaluation picks back up right after yield. You can see this in action by using multiple Python yield statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> def multi_yield():\n",
    "        ...     yield_str = \"This will print the first string\"\n",

    "        \n",
    "Take a closer look at that last calls to next(). You can see that execution has blown up with a <b>traceback. This is because generators, like all iterators, can be exhausted</b>. Unless your generator is infinite, you can iterate through it one time only. Once all values have been evaluated, iteration will stop and the for loop will exit. If you used next(), then instead you’ll get an explicit StopIteration exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: StopIteration is a natural exception that’s raised to signal the end of an iterator. for loops, for example, are         built around StopIteration. You can even implement your own for loop by using a while loop:\n",
