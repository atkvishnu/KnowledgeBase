# SQL DELETE Statement
#sql_delete
The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

### DELETE Syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM <table_name> 
WHERE condition;
```
> **Note:** Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the `WHERE` clause in the `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

## SQL DELETE Example

The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
```

The "Customers" table will now look like this:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3   | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4   | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK  |
| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |
## Delete All Records
#delete_all
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

```sql
DELETE FROM <table_name>;
```
The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers;
```


Q.
1. Delete all the records from the `Customers` table where the `Country` value is 'Norway'.

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Norway';
```

2. Delete all the records from the `Customers` table.

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers;
```

# SQL `TOP`, `LIMIT`, `FETCH FIRST` or `ROWNUM` Clause
#sql_top_limit_fetchfirst_rownum
## The SQL `SELECT TOP` Clause
#select_top
The `SELECT TOP` clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The `SELECT TOP` clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

> **Note:** Not all database systems support the `SELECT TOP` clause. MySQL supports the `LIMIT` clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses `FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY` and `ROWNUM`.

#### **SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT TOP <number> percent <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <conditions>;
```

#### MySQL Syntax:

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <conditions>
LIMIT <number>;
```
#### **Oracle 12 Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
ORDER BY <column_name(s)>
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
```
#### Older Oracle Syntax:

```sql
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <ROWNUM> <= <number>;
```
#### **Older Oracle Syntax (with ORDER BY):**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT column_name(s) FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <column_name(s)>)
WHERE <ROWNUM> <= <number>;
```

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 5   | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |
## SQL TOP, LIMIT and FETCH FIRST Examples

The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
#sql_top
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
```

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

## SQL TOP PERCENT Example
 The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
#sql_top_percent
```sql
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
```
Equivalent example for Oracle:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
```

## ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
#where_clause
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';
```
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
```
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

# SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
#sql_min_max
The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

The `MAX()` function returns the largest value of the selected column.

### MIN() Syntax
#sql_min
```sql
SELECT MIN(<column_name>)
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>;
```
### MAX() Syntax
#sql_max
```sql
SELECT MAX(<column_name>)
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>;
```

## Demo Database

Below is a selection from the "Products" table in the Northwind sample database:

| ProductID | ProductName | SupplierID | CategoryID | Unit | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Chais | 1   | 1   | 10 boxes x 20 bags | 18  |
| 2   | Chang | 1   | 1   | 24 - 12 oz bottles | 19  |
| 3   | Aniseed Syrup | 1   | 2   | 12 - 550 ml bottles | 10  |
| 4   | Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning | 2   | 2   | 48 - 6 oz jars | 22  |

SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;
```
## MAX() Example

The following SQL statement finds the price of the most expensive product:

```sql
SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
FROM Products;
```

Q.
1. Use the `MIN` function to select the record with the smallest value of the `Price` column.
```sql
SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;
```
2. Use an SQL function to select the record with the highest value of the `Price` column.
```sql
SELECT MAX(Price)
FROM Products;
```
