[Pringles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles "Pringles") fried snacks are in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid.

Who knew that `Pringles` were designed using a `hyperbolic paraboloid formula` to make them stacked static in the packaging and to prevent them from cracking easily!

A hyperbolic paraboloid is a [saddle surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_surface "Saddle surface"), as its [Gauss curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_curvature "Gauss curvature") is negative at every point. Therefore, although it is a ruled surface, it is not [developable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developable_surface "Developable surface").

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection]]

The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for navigation because it is unique in representing north as up and south as down everywhere while preserving local directions and shapes.
