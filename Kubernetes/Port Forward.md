Best Port for port forwarding:
If you are connecting to a PostgreSQL database from outside of your local network, you will need to forward the port on your router to allow external access to the database. In this case, you should choose a port that is not already in use by another service, to avoid conflicts.

It's generally recommended to use a port number between 49152 and 65535 for custom applications, as these ports are designated for dynamic and/or private use and are less likely to be used by other services. However, you can use any port that is not in use by another service.
