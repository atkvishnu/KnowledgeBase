# Phishing

Spear phishing - instead of going after many people, the attacker goes after a single high value target.

- make sure all the business related emails end with `@logiq.ai`.

Top tips:

- Check who the email sender really is.
- Check trhe email for grammer and spelling mistakes.
- Mouse over the link to see where it goes to. If unsure, do not click the link. Instead manually type in the company's URL in your browser.
- Contact your IT Security team if you're unsure about the email.
