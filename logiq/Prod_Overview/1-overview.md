- If you see an API performance issue with response time through a latency metric, the ability to drill down to the api trace next, followed by logs for a span that may show the issue becomes critical in faster root cause.

- Having MELT data sit in seperate systems is one of the main reasons why rpoot cause analysis is slow in most observability implementations. They are built as specialized silos that don't talk to each other.

- LOGIQ.AI is an integrated platform that provides a consistent view of all MELT data for faster root cause outcomes. Because LOGIQ.AI collects all the logs data, it also includes a buolt-in security monitoring layer for log-based HIDS(Host Intrusion Detection System) i.e., compatible with OSSec, Atomic and Wazuh agents. In addition, LOGIQ.AI integrates rules from the open source Sigma project for SIEM(Security information and event mgmt.) rule.
LOGIQ.AI brings a unified view for your enterprise with its full-stack approach to observability data life cycle mgmt. An integrated approach means its easier to root cause issues as all the capability work together in an integrated manner.
LOGIQ.AI is also a SOC2 Type2 Compliance platform and a member of `CNCF` (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).





- `MELT` stands for `Metrics`, `Events`, `Logs`, and `Traces`.
