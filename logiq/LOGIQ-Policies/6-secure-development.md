Purpose and Scope


The purpose of this document is to define basic rules for secure development of software and systems. 



This document is applied to the development and maintenance of all services, architecture, software and systems that make up LOGIQ's product/service.



Users of this document are all employees and applicable contractors who are involved with the development and maintenance of applications and systems at LOGIQ.


Secure Development and Maintenance

Securing the Development Environment 


Access to the development environment is restricted only to authorized employees via logical access control. Development and production environments are logically separated.


Secure Engineering Principles


LOGIQ developers follow secure information system engineering practices for the development of new systems and for the maintenance of the existing systems. Minimum-security standards must be maintained and complied with when implementing new systems.



The same secure engineering principles are applied to outsourced development.


Security Requirements Related to Public Networks


Pepe Juan is responsible for defining security controls related to information in application services passing over public networks:

the description of authentication systems to be used 
the description of how confidentiality and integrity of information is to be ensured 
the description of how non-repudiation of actions will be ensured


Pepe Juan is responsible for defining controls for online transactions, which must include the following:

how misrouting will be prevented 
how incomplete data transmission will be prevented 
how unauthorized message alteration will be prevented 
how unauthorized message duplication will be prevented 
how unauthorized data disclosure will be prevented 

Repository and Version Control


LOGIQ utilizes code version control management tools to track and manage code development, testing, and merges with production. Changes in the development and during the maintenance of the systems must be done according to the Change Management Policy.


Protection of Test Data


Confidential and restricted data, as well as data that can be related to individual persons should not be used as test data, except as required for customer debugging, where approved by customers or where approved by management.


Required Security Training


All engineers must periodically review the OWASP Top 10 as defined in the Change Management Policy. 



Exceptions


LOGIQ business needs, local situations, laws and regulations may occasionally call for an exception to this policy or any other LOGIQ policy. If an exception is needed, LOGIQ management will determine an acceptable alternative approach. 


Enforcement


Any violation of this policy or any other LOGIQ policy or procedure may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. LOGIQ reserves the right to notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities of any unlawful activity and to cooperate in any investigation of such activity. LOGIQ does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within an employee’s or contractor’s course and scope of work.



Any personnel who is requested to undertake an activity that he or she believes is in violation of this policy must provide a written or verbal complaint to his or her manager or any other manager of LOGIQ as soon as possible. 



The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees and contractors from violating organizational security policies and procedures, and any other security breaches.


Responsibility, Review, and Audit


LOGIQ reviews and updates its security policies and plans to maintain organizational security objectives and meet regulatory requirements at least annually. The results are shared with appropriate parties internally and findings are tracked to resolution. Any changes are communicated across the organization.
