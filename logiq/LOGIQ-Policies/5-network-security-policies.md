Purpose and Scope


The purpose of this document is to define basic rules and requirements for network security and ensure the protection of information within and across networks and supporting information processing facilities.

 

This document applies to the security of all services, architecture, software and systems that make up LOGIQ's product/service. 

 

Users of this document are all employees and applicable contractors who work on network engineering, security, and maintenance at LOGIQ.

 

Network Controls 


LOGIQ manages, controls, and secures its networks, the connected systems, applications, and data-in-transit to safeguard against internal and external threats.



Firewalls & Threat Defense


LOGIQ utilizes network and/or web application firewalls to safeguard networks and core applications from threats. LOGIQ configures appropriate firewall alerts and alarms for timely response and investigation.



LOGIQ ensures networking ports and protocols are restricted based on the principle of least functionality. Firewall configurations and rulesets are maintained. Firewall rules

are implemented to minimize exposure to external threats.



As an additional layer of defense, LOGIQ utilizes monitoring solutions to detect and alert on network-based threats.


Network Diagramming


Pepe Juan maintains network and data flow diagrams. Diagrams are reviewed and updated when significant network infrastructure changes occur.



Network Access Control


In addition to the Network Security Policy, LOGIQ establishes, documents, and reviews the Access Control and Termination Policy based on business and security requirements. This policy also encompasses network access control.



LOGIQ segregates networks based on the required groups of information services, users, and systems.



LOGIQ utilizes firewall configurations to restrict connections between untrusted networks and trusted networks.



Additionally, LOGIQ may utilize security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to improve network security for individual virtual machines.


Network Engineering


LOGIQ implements security functions in a layered approach, minimizing interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.



LOGIQ utilizes a defense-in-depth (DiD) architecture to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data, i.e. placing information systems that contain sensitive data in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks. 



LOGIQ synchronizes clocks of all applicable information systems to the same time protocol to enforce consistent and accurate timestamping.

 

Network Service Level Agreements (SLAs)


Security mechanisms, service levels and management requirements of all network services should be identified and included in network services agreements, whether these services are provided in-house or outsourced.



Exceptions


LOGIQ business needs, local situations, laws and regulations may occasionally call for an exception to this policy or any other LOGIQ policy. If an exception is needed, LOGIQ management will determine an acceptable alternative approach. 


Enforcement


Any violation of this policy or any other LOGIQ policy or procedure may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. LOGIQ reserves the right to notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities of any unlawful activity and to cooperate in any investigation of such activity. LOGIQ does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within an employee’s or contractor’s course and scope of work.



Any personnel who is requested to undertake an activity that he or she believes is in violation of this policy must provide a written or verbal complaint to his or her manager or any other manager of LOGIQ as soon as possible. 



The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees and contractors from violating organizational security policies and procedures, and any other security breaches.


Responsibility, Review, and Audit


LOGIQ reviews and updates its security policies and plans to maintain organizational security objectives and meet regulatory requirements at least annually. The results are shared with appropriate parties internally and findings are tracked to resolution. Any changes are communicated across the organization.
