Please get behind Ishwar to find a way to do the two items that are on his plate - they will otherwise skip March (edited) 


and behind Naman as well - Let's start fleshing out Journals with a plan and an EPIC and get it assigned to him



Other items are casdoor items



Alert Management will most likely skip March


also Mohan has to showcase Aggregate rules before week end - timeline was to bring to POC by 2nd week of March
