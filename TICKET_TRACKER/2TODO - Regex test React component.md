> Ranjan: Can you also work on introducing a regex test in the extract view page, for users to be able to do this effectively we should show them the matches and extracts in the ui itself.
     
> Me: Are you talking about integrating a modal in the extract page or just a link to regex101? There the users can test the regex against a log line.

> Ranjan: no it should be in extract page

> Me: this URL right? regex101.com

> [06/11/2022 10:22 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: yes something like that, if we have a reusable component that we can embed in various parts of rules page

> [06/11/2022 10:23 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: user types the actual log line, writes the regex and we can show him the matches / extracts live in the ui so its easy for them to see if there are errors etc.
Interesting site - https://www.autoregex.xyz

> Me: you told me to make api for this...

> [06/11/2022 10:30 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: not API - this can be purely in UI

> [06/11/2022 10:30 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: its a builtin regex evaluator using javascript only

> Me: okay. then this can be like a independent component.(edited)

> [06/11/2022 10:31 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: yes

> [06/11/2022 10:31 PM] Ranjan Parthasarathy: that way we can use this where user needs to do regex, Its one of the asks we got from Novartis.
