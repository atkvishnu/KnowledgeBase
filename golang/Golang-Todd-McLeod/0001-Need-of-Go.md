- In 2005-2006, first commercial dual core processors became available to public.
- Previous languages were made for utilizing single cores properly. No programming languages were designed to utilize multiple cores.

- But Go was created to natively utilize multiple cores.
- Go does concurrency and parallelism really well.

- In 2009, Go project was started and in March 2012 it was released as a Open source project - Version 1.

### 3 goals of Golang:
- Efficient Compilation:
	- Go creates compiled programs.
		- There is a garbage collector (GC).
		- There is no virtual machine.
- Efficient execution.
- Ease of programming.


### What Go is good for:
	- What Google does / web services at scale.
	- networking
		- http, tcp, udp
	- concurrency / parallelism
	- systems programming
	- automation, command-line tools
	- crypto
	- image processing

### Guiding principles of design
	- expressive, comprehensive, sophisticated
	- clean, clear and easy to read.

### Companies using Golang
	- Google, Youtube, Google Confidential, Docker, Kubernetes, InfluxDB, Twitter, Apple
